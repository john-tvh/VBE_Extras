# VBE_Extras
**VBE Extras ... extending the VBA editor**

What is VBE_Extras?

VBE_Extras is an AddIn for the Visual Basic Editor (VBE) within Excel, Word, Outlook and PowerPoint. It is designed to make coding with VBA quicker, simpler and less bug-prone. It does this by adding functionality to the VBE including:

**Declarations and references**
- Display all declarations in a particular Procedure/Property, Module or Project
- Display the declaration for any reference of that declarations
- Display all references of a declaration
- VBE_Extras works with all type of declarations: Variables, Procedures, Properties, Modules, Enums, Types, Controls etc
- As well as just displaying declarations and references, VBE_Extras can navigate you to the declaration (from any reference) or to any reference (from the declaration or from any other reference) including go to the next/previous reference
- And as well as displaying and navigating, VBE_Extras can rename the declaration and all of its references … this isn't just a re-packaged Find/Replace … VBE_Extras can handle declarations with the same name in the same scope (see the user guide section "Declarations with the same name in the same scope" for more info)
- For a declaration, highlight the declaration and all references on screen.

**Tasks (TODOs)**
- Show all tasks matching user-defined text criteria

**Cursor management / Sub to run**
- Set a cursor position to jump back to following running or compiling code (sometimes you don't want the VBE just moving your cursor to another line … or another Module, right!?) when running or compiling your code
- Set a 'Sub to run' that you then don't have to manually locate before pressing F5 (code in one place, run code from another) … optionally automatically clear, or jump to the end of, the Immediate window before the code is run
- Cursor history - want to jump back to where your cursor was previously? Or before that, or before that? And then jump forward again? VBE_Extras does that.

**Others**
- Edit Module-header attributes without manually exporting and re-importing the Module
- Module picker … jump to the last-viewed Module, or any other Module, will simple keyboard shortcuts
- And more … see the VBE_Extras guide (link below)
